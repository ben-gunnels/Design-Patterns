### Design Patterns
___

#### Creational Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. 

* Factory Method - provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of object created. Replaces object construction calls with calls to a special factory method.  
* Abstract Factory - lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. All products in a family share an interface with common methods. 
* Builder - creational design patterns that lets you construct complex objects stepwise. Allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. Example, building a house of different types and including different features. 
* Prototype - lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. This method allows you to clone all of the parts of a class including private data and methods. 
* Singleton - lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. 

#### Structural Patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. 

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

#### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. 

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor
